#### 1. First Steps

Our first step is installing Biopython. The easiest way is to Biopython is using ```pip``` package such as follows. (Please note that Biopython also requires NumPy package, which will be installed automatically if you install Biopython with ```pip```).

If you already have Biopython installed you can upgrade it using ```pip``` aswell. 

```python
pip install biopython
pip install --upgrade biopython
```

You can test if Biopython is properly installed by executing:

```python
import Bio
```

If no error messages appear, then everything is working and you're all set.

#### 2. Working with sequences

**Creating a sequence**

The easiest way to create a sequence is using the Biopython ```Seq``` object. The bio.seq module is really useful and we will make use of it constantly. You can check the [Wiki page](https://biopython.org/wiki/Seq) for more information and advice. Here is a small example.

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print("Sequence is", seq_example)
>>> Sequence is AGTACACTGGT
```

**Parsing a sequence file**

[Biopythonâ€™s SeqIO](https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO) (Sequence Input/Output) can be used to read sequence files. The main function is ```Bio.SeqIO.parse()```, which requires a filename and format and returns a SeqRecord iterator. This is an example of parsing a FASTA file.
```python
from Bio import SeqIO
for record in SeqIO.parse("example_sequence.fasta", "fasta"):
    print(record.seq)
```
```record.id``` will return the identifier of the sequence. ```record.seq``` will return the sequence itself. ```record.description``` will return the sequence description.

**Counting sequence length & number of occurrences of a nucleotide**

Counting sequence length is really easy using ```len()```. Using our previous example:

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print("Sequence is", seq_example)
>>> Sequence is AGTACACTGGT
print("The length of the sequence is", len(seq_example))
>>> The length of the sequence is 11
```
You can count numer of occurrences of a certain nucleotide as follows: (Make sure to create/load sequence as we've done earlier)

```python
print(seq_example.count("C"))
>>> 2
```

**Calculating GC-content**

[GC content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content) is a measure of the percentage of guanine (G) or cytosine (C) related to the total nitrogenous bases (A+T on DNA or A+U on RNA). GC content is important because it indicates a higher melting temperature and also key factor in bacteria taxonomy. Biopython has a ```Bio.SeqUtils``` [package](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.html) that simplifies this task. Feel free to check wiki for more information.

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print(GC(seq_example))
>>> 45.45
```

**Calculating molecular weight**

Again, molecular weight can be easily calculated using ```Bio.SeqUtils``` as follows:

```python
from Bio.SeqUtils import molecular_weight
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print(molecular_weight(seq_example))
>>> 3436.19
```

**Get the reverse complement of a sequence, transcription & translation**

Using Biopython these three processes ar really straightforward. To get the reverse complement use the single function ```reverse_complement()```.

```python
print("Reverse complement:", seq_example.reverse_complement())
>>> The reverse complement if the sequence is ACCAGTGTACT
```

Transcription is also a single function, ```transcribe()```

```python
print("Transcription:", seq_example.transcribe())
>>> Transcription: AGUACACUGGU
```

Translation is again another function, ```translate()```. Please note that if your sequence is not suitable for correct translation you will recieve a warning from Biopython (our example gets this warning). This happens if your sequence is not a multiple of three, which makes partial codons on translation (we'll come back to this later). You can have more information about this biological process [here](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Translation)

```python
print("Translation:", seq_example.translate())
>>> Translation: STL
```

**Slicing a sequence**

With Biopython you can slice effectively sequences and extract any part of it.

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print(seq_example[4:9])
>>> CACTG
```

It follows the usual indexing conventions for Python strings, with the first element of the sequence numbered 0. When you do a slice the first item is included (i.e. 4) and the last is excluded (9 in this case). We can get the third codon positions of this DNA sequence:

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print(seq_example[0::3])
>>> AACG
```

**Concatenating sequences**

You can add any two ```Seq``` objects together

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
seq_add = Seq("TTTT")
print(seq_example + seq_add)
>>> AGTACACTGGTTTTT
```

Biopython ```Seq``` also has a ```.join``` method which can be really useful

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
fragments = [Seq("AGTA"), Seq("CACT"), Seq("GGT")]
filler = Seq("G"*10)
print(filler.join(fragments))
>>> AGTAGGGGGGGGGGCACTGGGGGGGGGGGGT
```

**Find the starting index of a subsequence**

Easiest way to find starting index of a subsequence is using ```find()```

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
seq_example = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
print("CAC index:", seq_example.find("CAC"))
>>> CAC index: 4
```

**Writing sequences to a file**

SeqIO (Sequence Input/Output) can also be used to write sequences to files. Our main function is ```SeqIO.write()``` and it allows you to save sequences as well as id or descriptions (See below for instructions on how to enter Genbank and other NCBI tools). Here is an example:

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord
from Bio import SeqIO

rec1 = SeqRecord(
    Seq(
        "MMYQQGCFAGGTVLRLAKDLAENNRGARVLVVCSEITAVTFRGPSETHLDSMVGQALFGD"
        "GAGAVIVGSDPDLSVERPLYELVWTGATLLPDSEGAIDGHLREVGLTFHLLKDVPGLISK"
        "NIEKSLKEAFTPLGISDWNSTFWIAHPGGPAILDQVEAKLGLKEEKMRATREVLSEYGNM"
        "SSAC",
    ),
    id="gi|14150838|gb|AAK54648.1|AF376133_1",
    description="chalcone synthase [Cucumis sativus]",
)

rec2 = SeqRecord(
    Seq(
        "YPDYYFRITNREHKAELKEKFQRMCDKSMIKKRYMYLTEEILKENPSMCEYMAPSLDARQ"
        "DMVVVEIPKLGKEAAVKAIKEWGQ",
    ),
    id="gi|13919613|gb|AAK33142.1|",
    description="chalcone synthase [Fragaria vesca subsp. bracteata]",
)

rec3 = SeqRecord(
    Seq(
        "MVTVEEFRRAQCAEGPATVMAIGTATPSNCVDQSTYPDYYFRITNSEHKVELKEKFKRMC"
        "EKSMIKKRYMHLTEEILKENPNICAYMAPSLDARQDIVVVEVPKLGKEAAQKAIKEWGQP"
        "KSKITHLVFCTTSGVDMPGCDYQLTKLLGLRPSVKRFMMYQQGCFAGGTVLRMAKDLAEN"
        "NKGARVLVVCSEITAVTFRGPNDTHLDSLVGQALFGDGAAAVIIGSDPIPEVERPLFELV"
        "SAAQTLLPDSEGAIDGHLREVGLTFHLLKDVPGLISKNIEKSLVEAFQPLGISDWNSLFW"
        "IAHPGGPAILDQVELKLGLKQEKLKATRKVLSNYGNMSSACVLFILDEMRKASAKEGLGT"
        "TGEGLEWGVLFGFGPGLTVETVVLHSVAT",
    ),
    id="gi|13925890|gb|AAK49457.1|",
    description="chalcone synthase [Nicotiana tabacum]",
)

my_records = [rec1, rec2, rec3]
SeqIO.write(my_records, "seq_examples.faa", "fasta")
```

Output will be a fasta file with your sequences and records in a fasta file.  

**Converting a FASTQ file to FASTA file & other formats**

We need to convert DNA data file formats in certain applications. You can use ```SeqIO.write()``` but the easiest way to perform this common task is just ```SeqIO.convert()``` . See this example changing GenBank format to FASTA:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
count = SeqIO.convert("ls_orchid.gbk", "genbank", "orchid_converted.fasta", "fasta")
print("Converted %i records" % count)
```

Same concept, converting from FASTQ to FASTA as follows.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
count = SeqIO.convert("ls_orchid.fastq", "fastq", "orchid_converted.fasta", "fasta")
print("Converted %i records" % count)
```

See help function to have a complete list of conversions you can do:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
help(SeqIO.convert)
```

This is a wrap for this post! I hope you got an idea on how to use basic Biopython for sequence works. 

Thank you for reading. Feel free to check out our next post for more information on Biopython. Let me know if you have any feedback or issues, I'd love to hear from you!

#### 3. NCBI Entrez databases

**General Guidelines**

[Entrez](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Web/Search/entrezfs.html) is a data retrieval system that provides users access to NCBIâ€™s databases such as PubMed, GenBank, GEO, and many others. Using Biopython's module ```Bio.Entrez``` allows you to access Entrez and search & download records from within a Python script. You must provide an email to access Entrez - NCBI can block anonymous requests. Also,  ```Bio.Entrez``` might not be the best option to download huge amounts of data as it can clog the servers. 

```python
from Bio import Entrez
Entrez.email = "davidboo@example.com"
```

**Accessing PubMed, Medline, Genbank & others**

To search any of these databases, we use ```Bio.Entrez.esearch()``` module, which requires some parameters:

```python
handle = Entrez.esearch(db="value", term="keywords", retmax=100)
```

Where db are databases such as Pubmed, nucleotide, protein, snp, omim, unigene... keywords are what you are interested in looking at (organisms, Human, Biopython, urea...) and retmax are the number of identifies returned. 

Let's do an example accessing PubMed. We will be searching in PubMed for 20 publications that include breast cancer in their title.

```python
from Bio import Entrez
Entrez.email = "davidboo@example.com"
handle = Entrez.esearch(db="pubmed", term="breast[title] AND cancer[title]", retmax=20, rettype="fasta", retmode="text")
records = Entrez.read(handle)
print(records["IdList"])
```
If you want to retrieve a full record from Entrez, then you should use ```Bio.Entrez.efetch()```

```python
from Bio import Entrez
Entrez.email = "davidboo@example.com"
handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id="KY398842.1", rettype="gb", retmode="text")
print(handle.read())
```

If you fetch the record in one of the formats accepted by ```Bio.SeqIO```, you could directly parse it into a ```SeqRecord```:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import Entrez
Entrez.email = "davidboo@example.com"
handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id="KY398842.1", rettype="gb", retmode="text")
record = SeqIO.read(handle, "genbank")
handle.close()
print(record.id)
>>> KY398842.1
print(record.name)
>>> KY398842
print(record.description)
>>> Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus isolate RHDV BZ/2015 capsid structural protein VP60 gene, partial cds.
record.seq
>>> Seq('ATGGAGGGCAAAGCCCGCACAGCGCCGCAAGGCGAAGCAGCAGGCACTGCTAC...TGA')
```

#### 4. BLAST

**Running Web BLAST**

BLAST is an algorithm and program for comparing primary biological sequence information (i.e, protein or aminoacid sequences). Using Biopython, you can align sequences with Web BLAST which is the online version of BLAST, using the ```Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW``` module. Here is an example of a BLASTN (Nucleotide BLAST), searching a known sequence on the nucleotide database (nt).

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
record = SeqIO.read("seq_example.fasta", format="fasta")
results_handle = NCBIWWW.qblast("blastn", "nt", record.format("fasta"))

# You could now save the results in XML format output as default

with open("blastn_result.xml", "w") as out_handle:
    out_handle.write(result_handle.read())
result_handle.close()
```

For more information and other parameters make sure to check official information doing:

```python
from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW
help(NCBIWWW.qblast)
```

Please note that running a Web BLAST can be slower than a local BLAST, and you can create custom, personal databases to search for sequences against if running locally. You can find more information on the [official wiki](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#sec121) (and maybe some tutorial here soon ;) )

**Parsing a BLAST output**

Our saved BLAST output can be parsed as follows

```python
result_handle = open("blastn_result.xml")
```

As said earlier, our BLAST output is in XML format, so we can parse the result using ```NCBIXML```. Please note that we have used one query sequence and so, we are only getting one record. This code can be quickly adapted to multiple query sequences changing ```blast_record=NCBIXML.read(result_handle)``` to ```blast_records=NCBIXML.parse(result_handle)```

```python
from Bio.Blast import NCBIXML
blast_records = NCBIXML.read(result_handle)
```

You can also parse a BLAST XML output and get other important parameters, such as Length or e-value as follows:

```python
from Bio.Blast import NCBIXML
result_handle = open("seq_example.xml")
blast_record = NCBIXML.read(result_handle)
for alignment in blast_record.alignments:
     for hsp in alignment.hsps:
         if hsp.expect < 1e-10:
            print('Seq:', alignment.title)
            print('Length:', alignment.length)
            print('e-value:', hsp.expect)
            print(hsp.query)
            print(hsp.match)
            print(hsp.sbjct)
```
---

#### 5. Multiple Sequence Alignment

**Pairwise sequence alignment**

Pairwise sequence alignment methods are used to find the best-matching piecewise (local or global) alignments of two query sequences. In other words, a PSA is a tool used to compare two sequences to identify regions of similarity. We will be using the ```Bio.pairwise2``` module for PSA. Note that also ```Bio.Align.PairwiseAligner``` is available to use and it's faster for really big sequences.

We will be comparing two example sequences, ```seq_example``` and ```seq_example2``` in fasta format.

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

seq1 = SeqIO.read("seq_example.faa", "fasta")
seq2 = SeqIO.read("seq_example2.faa", "fasta")
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1.seq, seq2.seq)
print(alignments)
```

As you can see, in ```pairwise2.align.globalxx``` we find two parameters (written as xx) where you can specify the match score and gap penalties. The match score indicates the compatibility between an alignment of two characters in the sequences, and gap penalties is a negative number to apply when finding gaps between both sequences. You can read more information about this on [Biopython's API](https://biopython.org/docs/1.77/api/Bio.pairwise2.html). Better alignments are usually obtained by penalizing gaps: higher costs for opening a gap and lower costs for extending an existing gap.

Change the scoring scheme as it follows in this example (matching are given +2 points, -1 point for each mismatching character, -0.5 points when opening a gap, and -0.1 points when extending it)

```python
pairwise2.align.globalms(seq1.seq, seq2.seq, match=2, mismatch=-1, open=-.5, extend=-.1)
```

If you want do a local alignment of two sub-regions of a pair of sequences similarly, using ```pairwise2.align.localxx```
```python
alignments = pairwise2.align.localxx(seq1, seq2)
```

For amino acid sequences match scores are usually encoded in matrices like PAM or BLOSUM. Thus, a more meaningful alignment for our example can be obtained by using the BLOSUM62 matrix, together with a gap open penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.5. You can read more about amino acid score matrix on this [Nature article](http://bioinfo.ict.ac.cn/~dbu/BioinformaticsCourses/Lectures/BLOSUM.pdf)

```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Align import substitution_matrices
blosum62 = substitution_matrices.load("BLOSUM62")
seq1 = SeqIO.read("seq_example.faa", "fasta")
seq2 = SeqIO.read("seq_example2.faa", "fasta")
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalds(seq1.seq, seq2.seq, blosum62, -10, -0.5)
```

**Reading a MSA**

There are two functions for reading in sequence alignments, ```Bio.AlignIO.read()``` and ```Bio.AlignIO.parse()```, for files containing one or multiple alignments respectively. Usage is quite straightforward, however, you must include filename and alignment format type. This is one example with Stockholm file format:

```python
from Bio import AlignIO
alignment = AlignIO.read("RHDV_example.sth", "stockholm")
print(alignment)
```
And with fasta file format:

```python
from Bio import AlignIO
alignment = AlignIO.read("RHDV_example.faa", "fasta")
print(alignment)
```

**Multiple sequence alignment: creating alignment using different algorithms: ClustalW, MUSCLE...**

You can create your own multiple sequence alignment (MSA) when you want to compare more than two sequences to find regions with high similarity. The main function for this is ```Bio.AlignIO.write()```. However, Biopython provides command-line wrappers for the most common MSA tools: ClustalW, Clustal-O, MUSCLE, T-Coffee... Every algorithm is different and you should know the most optimal method to use in your case. You can get more information  about algorithms on [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10878092_Alignment-free_sequence_comparison_-_A_review). 

For example, if you want to use ClustalW, then first, you have to download its precompiled binaries. Then you can get an executable command as follows.

```python
from Bio.Align.Applications import ClustalwCommandline
cline = ClustalwCommandline("clustalw2", infile="seq_example.fasta")
print(cline)
```
And then you just run ```clustalw2``` on your terminal. Another example using Clustal-O:

```python
from Bio.Align.Applications import ClustalOmegaCommandline
in_file = "seq_example.fasta"
out_file = "seq_alignment.phylip"
clustalomega_cline = ClustalOmegaCommandline(infile=in_file, outfile=out_file, outfmt = 'phylip', verbose=True, auto=False)
print(clustalomega_cline)
```

And run ```clustalomega_cline```. You can convert between sequence alignment file formats using Biopython aswell. Here is an example code, from Stockholm format used earlier to ClustalW format:

```python
from Bio import AlignIO
count = AlignIO.convert("RHDV_example.sth", "stockholm", "RHDV_example.aln", "clustal")
```

#### 6. Phylogenetics

**Constructing a phylogenetic tree**

A phylogenetic tree is a branching diagram that represents evolutionary relationships among organisms or genes. They depict the evolution of a set of taxa from their most recent common ancestor (MRCA). It is one of the most important studies to perform in evolutionary genomics. You can read more about phylogenetic trees [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/phylogenetic-tree).

In Biopython, we can use ```Bio.Phylo``` module to create our own tree. As an example we will create a tree from a example file ([download here](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#sec249), from Biopython's API) named ```simple.dnd``` in Newick format.

```python
from Bio import Phylo
tree = Phylo.read("simple.dnd", "newick")
```

Using ```draw_ascii``` we can get a simple plain text dendrogram

```python
from Bio import Phylo
tree = Phylo.read("simple.dnd", "newick")
Phylo.draw_ascii(tree)
```

However you can get a prettier tree using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), a library for creating visualizations in Python

```python
tree.rooted = True
Phylo.draw(tree)
```

Exactly as in MSA, there are three main categories of algorithms avaliable to construct a phylogenetic tree: Distance-based methods, Maximum Parsimony (MP) methods and probabilistic methods. You can read more about the differences [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_alignment). Biopython allows you to choose the model you want to use with ```DistanceTreeConstructor``` and ```ParsimonyTreeConstructor``` such as:

```python
from Bio import Phylo
from Bio.Phylo.TreeConstruction import DistanceCalculator
from Bio.Phylo.TreeConstruction import DistanceTreeConstructor
from Bio import AlignIO

alignment = AlignIO.read('simple.dnd', 'newick')
constructor = DistanceTreeConstructor()
calculator = DistanceCalculator('identity')
dm = calculator.get_distance(alignment)
tree = constructor.upgma(dm)
Phylo.draw_ascii(tree)
```
The output is an UPGMA tree created from our input file. If you want to get a Neighbour Joining tree (which is a Distance based method) just do:

```python
njtree = constructor.nj(dm)
print(njtree)
```

**Modifying an existing tree**

The simplest way to get an overview of a tree object is to print it as we saw earlier:

```python
from Bio import Phylo
tree = Phylo.read("simple.dnd", "newick")
print(tree)
```

If you have your tree in a PhyloXML format, you can color different branches or apply different widths. Please note that you can still save a tree as Newick, but the color and width values will be skipped in the output file. To apply colors just do:
   
```python
tree = tree.as_phyloxml()
tree.root.color = "gray"
Phylo.draw(tree)
```

Colors for a clade are treated as cascading down through the entire clade, so when we colorize the root here, it turns the whole tree gray. We can override that by assigning a different color lower down on the tree using:

```python
tree.clade[0, 1].color = "blue"
tree.clade[2, 3].color = "red"
Phylo.draw(tree)
```
